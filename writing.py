"""Turn conversation into memory, once there is enough of it.

Folding turns into topic files costs a model call, so it waits until a
batch has gathered — roughly sixteen thousand tokens of conversation,
rather than a call per turn.

The conversation is read back from the session store rather than
accumulated in memory. That store is durable and ordered, so a turn's
identity survives a worker restart, and the cursor in ``runtime/online``
can tell what has already been written without keeping any state of its
own here. The alternative, buffering turns in a module-level dict, loses
the buffer on restart and hands out positions that change between runs —
which is exactly what a cursor cannot tolerate.
